      <h1 class={styles.heading}>Diverse experience</h1>

      <p class={styles.text}>
        For over 20 years, Bramel has been developing innovative corporate finance
        solutions for clients and partners that deliver measurable results.
      </p>

      <p class={styles.text}>
        Bramel's team has diverse experience across different businesses, sectors and
        as shareholders, funders and operators.
      </p>

      <p class={styles.text}>
        Leveraging this experience, Bramel has participated and assisted with:
      </p>

      <ul class={styles.bulletList}>
        <li class={styles.bulletItem}>Mergers &amp; acquisitions, including management and leveraged buyouts</li>
        <li class={styles.bulletItem}>Listings and delistings</li>
        <li class={styles.bulletItem}>Capital raising, including equity and debt funding</li>
        <li class={styles.bulletItem}>Special opportunity transactions</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class={styles.subheading}>A partnership ethos</h2>

      <p class={styles.text}>
        Bramel has acted as a seller and a buyer of assets, and also been an active
        participant in the management structure of businesses subject to buyouts,
        recapitalisations and rigorous restructurings.
      </p>

      <p class={styles.text}>
        This 'close to the bone' experience uniquely positions Bramel to work with
        shareholders and management teams as a partner rather than as an
        independent firm shield from the challenges and vagaries of a transaction.
      </p>
